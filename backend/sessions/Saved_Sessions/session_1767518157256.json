Here are the key responsibilities:\n\n- **Preparation and Dissemination**: Each SEA and LEA that receives Title I funds must prepare and disseminate an annual report card that includes information about public schools related to various performance metrics, accountability, per-pupil expenditures, and educator qualifications.\n- **Content Requirements**: The report card must include information that is concise, understandable, and presented in a uniform format accessible to the public, including individuals with disabilities. It should also be provided in a language that parents and stakeholders can understand, to the extent practicable.\n- **Timeliness**: Report cards should ideally be issued before the start of the succeeding school year or as early as possible in the new school year to facilitate open discussions about school performance.\n- **Consultation with Parents**: SEAs are required to consult with parents in developing the State report card, and LEAs are encouraged to do the same for local report cards.\n- **Accessibility**: Report cards must be widely accessible, including being posted on the SEA and LEA websites. SEAs and LEAs must ensure that the information does not reveal personally identifiable information about individual students.\n- **Use of Title I Funds**: SEAs and LEAs may use Title I administrative funds to prepare and disseminate the required report cards.\n\nThese responsibilities ensure transparency and accountability in the education system, providing essential information to parents and stakeholders about school performance and resources.\n\n#### Sources\n- ESEA Report Card Analyzer Database"

      "content": "### Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\nThe Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is a U.S. law passed in December 2015 that governs the country's K-12 public education policy. It replaced the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and aims to provide all students with a fair, equitable, and high-quality education. Here are some key features of ESSA:\n\n- **State Control**: ESSA gives states more authority to determine how to improve student outcomes and hold schools accountable for performance.\n- **Standardized Testing**: The law maintains the requirement for annual standardized testing in reading and math for students in grades 3-8 and once in high school, but it allows states to develop their own accountability systems.\n- **Support for Low-Performing Schools**: States are required to identify and provide support for schools that are consistently underperforming.\n- **Focus on Equity**: ESSA emphasizes the need to close achievement gaps among different student groups, including those from low-income families, students with disabilities, and English language learners.\n- **Teacher Quality**: The law includes provisions to ensure that all students have access to effective teachers and that states develop plans to improve teacher quality.\n- **Local Flexibility**: ESSA allows for more local control and flexibility in how schools use federal funds, encouraging innovative approaches to education.\n\nOverall, ESSA aims to ensure that all students, regardless of their background, have access to a quality education and the resources they need to succeed.\n\n#### Sources\n- General knowledge based on training and understanding of U.S. education policy."
