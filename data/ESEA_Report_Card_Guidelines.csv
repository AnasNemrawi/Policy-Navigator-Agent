A,A-1,What are the responsibilities of an SEA and an LEA for preparing a report card?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1) and (h)(2),"The ESEA requires that each SEA and LEA that receives Title I funds prepare and disseminate an annual report card. Generally, an SEA and LEA is required by the ESEA to include on its report card information about public schools related to a wide variety of student and school performance metrics, accountability, per-pupil expenditures, and educator qualifications, as well as any other information that the SEA or LEA deems relevant. The ESEA requires that State and local report cards be concise and presented in an understandable and uniform format accessible to the public, including persons with disabilities, and, to the extent practicable, provided in a language that parents and other stakeholders can understand."
A,A-2,When should an SEA or LEA post annual report cards on its website?,SEA and LEA,"ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(A), (B)(iii) and (h)(2)(A), (B)(iii)","Under the ESEA, report cards must be posted annually on SEA and LEA websites. Although an SEA and LEA has discretion regarding when to issue its report card, parents and other stakeholders will likely find it most useful if the report cards are issued before the start of the succeeding school year or as early in the succeeding school year as possible (e.g., back-to-school time). Timely publication of report cards will encourage and foster open and transparent discussion between parents and other stakeholders and school officials about school performance."
A,A-3,Is there a particular report card style or format that an SEA or an LEA must use?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(B) and (h)(2)(B),"No. The ESEA requires that State and local report cards be concise, presented in an understandable and uniform format, and accessible to the public. Beyond these requirements, SEAs and LEAs have flexibility to use the report card style or format they determine to be most effective in presenting information to stakeholders, including parents. To help ensure that parents contribute to decisions related to report cards, the ESEA requires that SEAs consult with parents in developing the State report card. In addition, LEAs may want to consider consulting with parents in developing the local report card."
A,A-4,Are there considerations or principles for displaying student and school performance data that may be helpful to SEAs and LEAs as they develop prepare and disseminate State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"As noted above, within certain parameters described in the ESEA, SEAs and LEAs have flexibility to design State and local report cards that best suit their particular contexts. In determining the design of report cards, SEAs and LEAs may want to consider various questions such as: Does the report card reflect feedback based on different presentation formats? Are the data available in both chart/graph and table format? Does the report card include narrative summaries in plain language? Is social media embedded? Does the report card link to historical information? Is the information provided in a mobile-ready format? Are the State and local report cards disseminated in formats accessible to individuals with disabilities and those with limited English proficiency?"
A,A-5,How can an SEA and LEA meet the requirement for report cards to be concise?,SEA and LEA,ESEA sections 1111(h)(1)(B)(i) and (h)(2)(B)(i),"ESEA sections 1111(h)(1)(B)(i) and (h)(2)(B)(i) require that State and local report cards be concise. An SEA and LEA has flexibility in determining how to ensure its report card is presented in a concise manner. For example, an SEA and LEA could: Provide an introductory section that includes information on key metrics and/or student groups that can help parents and other stakeholders quickly access and understand such information; Provide the report card on an interactive platform that allows users to see high-level data and access additional information through drop-down menus or other interactive tools."
A,A-6,What does the ESEA require regarding how an SEA and LEA can ensure the accessibility of report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(B) and (h)(2)(B),"The ESEA requires that State and local report cards be widely accessible to the public. Specifically, report cards must be in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, written in a language that parents can understand."
A,A-7,How might an SEA and LEA ensure that its report card is accessible to parents who are limited English proficient?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(B) and (h)(2)(B),"Report cards must be, to the extent practicable, provided in a language that parents can understand. Depending on local needs, it may be necessary for the SEA and LEA to produce versions of its report card in other languages or support local translations of report card information. For example, an SEA and LEA might translate the report card into the languages spoken by the major language groups served by the SEA and LEA and distribute the translated copies to parents who are limited English proficient. Parents and other stakeholders who are not from the major language groups must also have meaningful access through translation upon request, effective summaries, or oral interpretations."
A,A-8,How might an SEA or an LEA ensure that its report card is accessible to parents with disabilities?,SEA and LEA,28 CFR § 35.160 and 34 CFR § 104.4(b)(1)(iii),"An SEA and LEA have an obligation under Section 504 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to ensure that communications with individuals with disabilities are as effective as communications with non-disabled individuals. Thus, each SEA and LEA must disseminate its annual report cards in a manner that provides parents with disabilities and individuals with disabilities who are members of the public with an equal opportunity to access the report cards. To do so, the SEA and LEA may need to take appropriate steps, including providing accommodations or modifications when necessary."
A,A-9,How can an SEA or LEA ensure the online accessibility of its report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(B)(iii) and (h)(2)(B)(iii)(I),"The ESEA requires that an SEA make its report card available on a single webpage of the SEA's website. Similarly, if an LEA has a website, the ESEA requires that the LEA post the local report card on such website. To ensure accessibility of State and local report cards on websites, SEAs and LEAs may consider meeting modern standards such as the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and the Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite 1.2 for web content."
A,A-10,How can an SEA and an LEA ensure that the information on its report card does not reveal personally identifiable information about individual students?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(i); 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99,"The ESEA requires that when presenting data on a report card, an SEA and LEA ensure that it protects the privacy of individuals and the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII) contained in students' education records consistent with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Likewise, personally identifiable data on students who are children with disabilities are subject to the confidentiality provisions in the IDEA, which are generally consistent with FERPA. Accordingly, the ESEA requires that the number of students, teachers, or principals or other school leaders in a category of reported data generally be sufficient so that it does not reveal personally identifiable information."
A,A-11,May an SEA and LEA use Title I funds to prepare and disseminate its report card?,SEA and LEA,N/A,Yes. An SEA and LEA may use its administrative funds under Title I to prepare and disseminate the report cards required by ESEA section 1111(h).
A,A-12,How can an SEA or an LEA ensure the accuracy of its report card data?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"It is extremely important that an SEA and LEA have systematic and uniform data collection guidelines, a system of internal controls, and an infrastructure to collect, produce, and report data that are accurate, reliable, and high quality. Please be aware that individuals and entities responsible for reporting inaccurate data could be subject to civil fines and penalties. The intentional reporting of inaccurate data could lead to criminal prosecution and penalties in addition to any civil consequences. An SEA and LEA, and all its employees, contractors, and other agents, must promptly refer to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) any credible evidence of suspected fraud or the intentional manipulation or reporting of incorrect data."
A,A-13,Must an SEA and LEA include information for private school students and teachers on its report card?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1) and (h)(2),No. The report card requirements in ESEA section 1111(h)(1) and (h)(2) apply only to public schools and LEAs.
A,A-14,Must an SEA and LEA maintain its prior year report cards?,SEA and LEA,2 CFR § 200.334 and 34 CFR § 76.731,"Yes. States are required to maintain at least three years of State and local report cards consistent with the requirements in 2 CFR § 200.334 and 34 CFR § 76.731. Because the requirement is to publicly report the State and local report cards, the prior year report cards must be publicly available."
B,B-1,What information must an SEA include on its State report card?,SEA,ESEA sections 1003(i); 1111(h)(1)(C); and 8401(e),The ESEA requires that each SEA that receives Title I funds prepare and disseminate an annual report card. State report cards must include information on the following categories: Clear and concise description of the State accountability system; Student achievement at each level on required assessments; Information on performance on other academic and school quality indicators; 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rates and extended-year rates if applicable; Number and percentage of English learners achieving English language proficiency; Information on progress toward State-designed long-term goals; Percentage of students assessed and not assessed; CRDC information; Educator qualifications; Per-pupil expenditures; Number and percentage of students with significant cognitive disabilities taking alternate assessments; NAEP results at grades 4 and 8; Postsecondary enrollment information if available; School improvement funds information; Waiver information if applicable; and any other information the SEA deems relevant.
B,B-2,What additional information might an SEA include on its State report card?,SEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(xiv),"An SEA may include on its State report card any other information it believes will best inform parents, students, and other members of the public about the progress of each elementary and secondary school. For example, an SEA might include information on: percentage of students requiring remediation in postsecondary education, career and technical certifications, 9th-graders promoted on time, teacher workforce characteristics, school readiness, accelerated coursework participation and completion, college entrance exam participation and scores, FAFSA completion, achievement on other statewide assessments, parent and student surveys, and demographic information. When considering optional information, the ESEA requires an SEA to ensure such information does not reveal personally identifiable information about individual students."
B,B-3,How does the ESEA require an SEA to disseminate its State report card?,SEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(B)(iii),"The ESEA requires an SEA to disseminate its annual report card by making it available on a single page of the SEA's website. However, because not all parents or members of the public have access to the internet, an SEA might consider additional methods such as: printing copies for schools, libraries, and public locations; emailing information to parents; distributing via newspapers and media; developing public service announcements; engaging stakeholder groups; and developing smartphone applications. When using an online interactive report card, an SEA may wish to provide information on how to access and use its features, offer workshops, develop training videos, or provide other assistance."
B,B-4,Does the ESEA require that an SEA provide to the public information that can be cross-tabulated by student group?,SEA,ESEA section 1111(g)(2)(N),"Yes. For certain State report card elements, the ESEA requires that an SEA provide to the public information in an easily accessible and user-friendly manner that can be cross-tabulated by student groups. The ESEA requires that these student groups include, at a minimum, each major racial and ethnic group, gender, English proficiency status, and status as a child with or without disabilities. States may at their discretion include other student groups. In providing information that can be cross-tabulated, the ESEA requires that the SEA ensure it does not reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student or include in any student group a number of students that is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information, and that it complies with FERPA requirements."
B,B-5,For which data elements does the ESEA require that an SEA provide information that can be cross-tabulated by student group?,SEA,ESEA section 1111(g)(2)(N),"The ESEA requires that an SEA provide certain data elements from State report cards in a manner that can be cross-tabulated by, at a minimum, each major racial and ethnic student group, gender, English proficiency status, and children with and without disabilities on each of the following: Student achievement on academic assessments in mathematics, reading/language arts, and science at each level of achievement; For elementary and secondary schools that are not high schools, performance on the Academic Progress indicator; High school graduation rates, including four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate and any extended-year rates adopted by the State; and The percentage of students assessed and not assessed on academic assessments."
B,B-6,What does it mean to provide information that can be cross-tabulated by student group?,SEA,ESEA section 1111(g)(2)(N),"In basic terms, cross-tabulating information on a measure means analyzing and displaying the information in a table using multiple discrete variables. Providing information that can be cross-tabulated by student group means that the SEA enables users to create a table of results on the measure using multiple student groups. For example, through cross-tabulation, a user could obtain the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate for students based on a combination of English proficiency and disability status. To meet the requirement, an SEA must ensure that users can obtain results for any combination of student groups, provided such combination does not reveal personally identifiable information, include insufficient numbers for statistical reliability, or otherwise violate FERPA requirements."
B,B-7,What information about school improvement funds reserved under ESEA section 1003 does the ESEA require that an SEA include on the State report card?,SEA,ESEA section 1003(i),"Under section 1003(a) of the ESEA, an SEA is required to reserve a portion of its Title I allocation to assist LEAs that serve schools implementing comprehensive support and improvement plans or targeted support and improvement plans. The ESEA further requires that the State report card include a list of all the LEAs and schools that received section 1003 school improvement funds, including the amount of funds allocated to an LEA overall and the amount allocated to serve each identified school included in the LEA's application and the types of strategies implemented in each school with such funds."
B,B-8,How might an SEA display on the State report card the required information about school improvement funds?,SEA,N/A,"SEAs have flexibility in how they display the required information. One approach an SEA may consider would be to create a table with columns for the LEA name, school name, school identification (e.g., Comprehensive Support and Improvement), amount of funds received, and type of strategy or strategies implemented."
C,C-1,What information does the ESEA require that an LEA include on its report card?,LEA,ESEA sections 1111(h)(1)(C) and (h)(2)(C); and 8401(e),"In general, the ESEA requires that an LEA, including a charter school LEA, that receives Title I funds report the same information on local report cards as is required for State report cards (with the exception of school improvement funds information). The ESEA also requires that an LEA report all information for the LEA as a whole and for each school served by the LEA, including public charter schools. Thus, although individual school report cards are not required, information about each school is required to be included on the local report card. Local report cards must include: All information required on State report cards as applied to the LEA and each school, except school improvement funds information; Student achievement comparisons showing how LEA students achieved compared to State students, and how school students achieved compared to LEA and State students; and any other information the LEA deems relevant."
C,C-2,May an LEA include additional information on its report card?,LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(2)(D),"Yes. In addition to the data elements required by the ESEA, an LEA may include any other information it determines to be appropriate, whether or not that information is included on the State report card. An LEA may wish to include supplemental information that parents may find useful. When considering optional information to include, the ESEA requires an LEA to ensure that such information does not reveal personally identifiable information about individual students."
C,C-3,How does the ESEA require that an LEA disseminate its report card?,LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(2)(B)(iii),"The ESEA requires that an LEA make the annual local report card publicly available on the LEA's website. If an LEA does not operate a website, the LEA may provide the information to the public in another manner determined by the LEA. For example, an LEA may make copies of the local report card available at the LEA administrative office, each school served by the LEA, local libraries, or other locations widely accessible to the public."
C,C-4,How can an LEA help parents to understand and act on the information provided on the local report card particularly information related to the schools their children attend?,LEA,N/A,"In addition to making local report cards publicly available, LEAs and schools may want to support parents in understanding the information provided in local report cards. Taking into consideration the context of the particular LEA and school, LEA and school staff may want to consider helping parents understand through opportunities such as: back-to-school nights, parent-teacher conferences, bilingual/multilingual community forums, brief webinars on accessing and reading report cards, teacher or school staff phone calls to parents, messaging via social media, and focus groups during family events. Schools can use report cards as one mechanism to engage parents in school improvement efforts."
D,D-1,What achievement data does the ESEA require an SEA and LEA to include on its report card?,SEA and LEA,"ESEA sections 1111(b)(2)(B)(xi), 1111(h)(1)(C)(ii) and (h)(2)(C)","The ESEA requires that State and local report cards include information on student achievement based on the reading/language arts, mathematics, and science assessments administered under ESEA section 1111(b)(2). In reporting achievement data, SEAs and LEAs must include data at each level of achievement, as determined by the State, for all students and disaggregated by each major racial and ethnic student group, economically disadvantaged students as compared to students who are not economically disadvantaged, children with disabilities as compared to children without disabilities, English proficiency status, gender, migrant status, students experiencing homelessness, students in foster care, and military-connected students."
D,D-2,How must an SEA calculate student achievement for the purposes of State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(ii) and (h)(2)(C),"In calculating and reporting student achievement results, the ESEA requires that an SEA and LEA include all students tested. Thus, the denominator for this calculation must include all students enrolled during the testing window who participated in the assessment. The numerator must include the number of students at each level of achievement based on the State's grade-level academic achievement standards. Note that the denominator for this calculation must equal the numerator used in the calculation of the participation rate."
D,D-3,For purposes of disaggregating achievement data on State and local report cards what definitions apply?,SEA and LEA,34 CFR § 200.2(b)(11),"The ESEA does not define each of the student groups for which an SEA and LEA must disaggregate achievement data. Under 34 CFR § 200.2(b)(11), however, a State's assessment system must enable results to be disaggregated within each State, LEA, and school by the same student groups required for reporting student achievement and in accordance with specific definitions for: English proficiency status (as defined in ESEA section 8101(20)); Children with disabilities (defined per IDEA section 602(3)); Migrant status (as defined in ESEA section 1309(3)); Homeless status (as defined per McKinney-Vento Act section 725(2)); Foster care status; and Military connected status (as defined per the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 amendment)."
D,D-4,In reporting student achievement for the English learner student group may an SEA and an LEA include results for former English learners?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(ii) and (h)(2)(C),"No. It is important that parents and the public have a clear picture of the academic achievement of students who are currently learning English. Therefore, the ESEA provides that in reporting on the English learner student group, an SEA and LEA may only include current English learners in reporting on student achievement on the assessments required under ESEA section 1111(b)(2). (Note: For purposes of the State accountability system and not the reporting requirement, an SEA may include the results of former English learners for not more than four years after such students cease to be identified as English learners.)"
D,D-5,In reporting student achievement for the children with disabilities student group may an SEA and LEA include results for children who were formerly identified as children with disabilities?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(ii) and (h)(2)(C),"No. It is important that parents and the public have a clear picture of the academic achievement of students who are currently receiving special education services under the IDEA. Therefore, the ESEA requires that in reporting on the children with disabilities student group, an SEA and LEA may include only current children with disabilities in reporting on student performance on the assessments required under ESEA section 1111(b)(2)."
D,D-6,If an SEA exempts recently arrived English learners from the first administration of its reading/language arts assessment how is achievement for these students reported on State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(b)(3)(A)(i); 34 CFR § 200.6(i)(1)(iii),"An SEA has the flexibility to exempt English learners in their first 12 months of schooling in the United States from one administration of the reading/language arts assessment. If an SEA takes advantage of this flexibility, both the SEA and its LEAs must report on State and local report cards, respectively, the number of recently arrived English learners who are exempted from taking the reading/language arts assessment. Since these students do not take the reading/language arts assessment, an SEA and LEA would not include such students in the achievement calculation. However, an SEA and LEA may include these students as participants in calculating the participation rate for the State reading/language arts assessment if they take the State's English language proficiency assessment. Recently arrived English learners are required to participate in the mathematics and science assessments."
D,D-7,How must an SEA and LEA report results for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards (AA-AAAS) under ESEA section 1111(b)(2)(D)?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(ii) and (h)(2)(C),"In reporting on student achievement, the ESEA requires that State and local report cards include the results for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take an AA-AAAS under ESEA section 1111(b)(2)(D). Thus, the number or percentage of students at each level of achievement must include students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take an AA-AAAS. In addition, State and local report cards must include the number and percentages of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take an AA-AAAS, by grade and subject."
D,D-8,What information must an SEA and LEA include on its report card regarding participation rates?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(vii) and (h)(2)(C),"The ESEA requires that an SEA and LEA report, for all students and disaggregated by each student group described in ESEA section 1111(b)(2)(B)(xi) (each major racial and ethnic group; economically disadvantaged students as compared to students who are not economically disadvantaged; children with disabilities as compared to children without disabilities; English proficiency status; gender; and migrant status) the percentage of students assessed and not assessed on the State's mathematics, reading/language arts, and science assessments."
D,D-9,May an SEA and LEA count students without a valid score as participating in the State assessments?,SEA and LEA,"ESEA section 1111(b)(2)(B)(ii), (vii); 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(16)(A); 34 CFR § 300.160(a)","No. Only students with a valid score, as determined by the State, may be counted as participants on the State assessments. Under the ESEA, a State must design an assessment system that provides coherent information about student attainment of challenging State academic standards and use that system to assess all students in the tested grades in a valid and reliable manner, including students with disabilities and English learners. Given the requirement to assess all students, participation rate plays an important role in calculating the academic achievement indicator. Accordingly, students without a valid score may not be reported as participating in State assessments on either the State or local report card."
E,E-1,What information must State and local report cards include regarding a description of the statewide accountability system?,SEA and LEA,"ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(i), (h)(2)(C)","The ESEA requires that State and local report cards include a clear and concise description of the State accountability system. This information is intended to help ensure that parents, teachers, principals, and other key stakeholders have access to information on each element of the State accountability system and how the elements work together in a coherent system. The ESEA requires State and local report cards to include a description of: the minimum n-size; State-designed long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for academic achievement, graduation rate, and English language proficiency; indicators used in the accountability system; the system for meaningfully differentiating schools including specific weights of indicators, methodology of differentiation, methodology for identifying consistently underperforming schools, and methodology for comprehensive support and improvement identification; and exit criteria for comprehensive support and improvement schools and additional targeted support and improvement schools."
E,E-2,How can SEAs and LEAs meet the requirement to include a description of the State accountability system on State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"SEAs and LEAs may meet the requirement to provide a description of the State accountability system by including such information directly on State and local report cards, respectively. SEAs and LEAs may also meet this requirement by providing the web address and linking to the description, provided the web page to which it links includes all of the accountability system description elements. SEAs and LEAs may want to describe the State accountability system in a way that enables parents and other stakeholders to understand what the system means and its implication for students."
E,E-3,What information must State and local report cards include regarding results of the statewide accountability system?,SEA and LEA,"ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(i)(V), (h)(1)(C)(iii), (h)(1)(C)(v)-(vi), (h)(2)(C)","The ESEA requires that State and local report cards include the following results of the State accountability system: The number and names of all public schools identified for comprehensive or targeted support and improvement; and For all students and disaggregated by each student group as defined in ESEA section 1111(c)(2): Information on performance on the Other Academic indicator for elementary schools that are not high schools; Four-year adjusted cohort graduation rates and, if adopted by the State, extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rates (also disaggregated by homeless status and foster care status); Information on performance on the School Quality or Student Success indicator; and Information on the progress of students toward meeting the State-determined long-term goals, including progress against measurements of interim progress."
E,E-4,What additional information may help parents and other stakeholders understand the performance and progress of schools based on the State accountability system?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"In reporting the number and names of all identified public schools, an SEA and its LEAs may wish to indicate, for each school identified for comprehensive support and improvement or targeted support and improvement, the reason the school was identified. For comprehensive support schools, this would include: lowest-performing 5 percent of Title I schools; high school with graduation rate of 67 percent or lower; or Title I school previously identified for additional targeted support that failed to meet exit criteria. For targeted support schools, this would include: consistently underperforming student groups; or additional targeted support based on student group performance. The Department encourages reporting on individual measures or components within indicators when an indicator comprises multiple measures (e.g., for a college and career readiness indicator that includes multiple components)."
E,E-5,For which indicators may an SEA and LEA include former English learners in reporting the accountability system results for the English learner student group?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"For not more than four years after a student ceases to be identified as an English learner, an SEA and its LEAs may include the reading/language arts and mathematics assessment results of such student on State and local report cards for purposes of reporting the results of the English learner student group on any accountability indicator that relies on those assessments, including the Academic Achievement indicator, the Other Academic indicator if applicable, or a School Quality or Student Success indicator if applicable. An SEA and LEA may also include these results when calculating and reporting the progress of the English learner student group toward meeting State-designed long-term goals. An SEA and LEA may not include former English learners in reporting any other information required under ESEA section 1111(h), such as student performance on academic assessments or other indicators not relying on reading/language arts or mathematics assessments."
E,E-6,May an SEA or LEA include the assessment results for children who were formerly identified as children with disabilities in reporting on any accountability system results for the children with disabilities student group?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"No. The ESEA does not allow an SEA or LEA to include the assessment results for children who were formerly identified as children with disabilities in reporting on any accountability system results for the children with disabilities student group. Note, however, that for purposes of calculating and reporting graduation rates for the children with disabilities student group, a State may include students who were children with disabilities at any time during their graduation cohort period."
E,E-7,Must an SEA and LEA include the results for children with disabilities who take an AA-AAAS for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in calculating and reporting accountability determinations?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"Yes. The ESEA requires that an SEA and LEA include all children with disabilities, including those who are students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take an AA-AAAS, in each indicator in the State's accountability system, including achievement on the AA-AAAS in the Academic Achievement indicator."
E,E-8,How must the performance of recently arrived English learners on reading/language arts and mathematics assessments be reported for accountability purposes on State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(b)(3)(A); 34 CFR § 200.6(i)(1)(iii),"Under ESEA section 1111(b)(3)(A), an SEA has flexibility regarding how it includes recently arrived English learners in statewide reading/language arts and mathematics assessments and related accountability goals and indicators. The ESEA provides two exceptions to the general requirement. Under the first exception, an SEA may: exempt a recently arrived English learner from one administration of reading/language arts; exclude results on mathematics and English language proficiency assessments for accountability in the first year; and include results in the second year and thereafter. Under the second exception, an SEA may: assess and report but exclude results for accountability in the first year; include growth measures in the second year; and include proficiency measures in the third and succeeding years. Under either exception, all recently arrived English learners must be assessed on mathematics and science assessments, and results must be included in reporting on student achievement every year."

F,F-1,What is the data collected under section 203(c)(1) of the Department of Education Organization Act that SEAs and LEAs must include on report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(1)(D); 20 U.S.C. 3413(c)(1),"The data collected pursuant to section 203(c)(1) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3413(c)(1)) includes the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) and the chronic absenteeism file of the EDFacts initiative. Specifically, the ESEA requires that State and local report cards include the following information: In-school suspension rates (CRDC); Out-of-school suspension rates (CRDC); Expulsion rates (CRDC); School-related arrest rates (CRDC); Referrals to law enforcement rates (CRDC); Chronic absenteeism rates, including both excused and unexcused absences (EDFacts); Incidents of violence rates, including bullying and harassment (CRDC); Enrollment in preschool programs, including number only (CRDC); and Enrollment in accelerated coursework to earn postsecondary credit, including both number and percentage (CRDC). The ESEA specifies that these data must be provided on State and local report cards for all students and disaggregated by the same student groups as required to be reported under the CRDC and EDFacts, but only to the extent those student groups align with the subgroups required under ESEA section 1111(b)(2)(B)(xi). That is, the ESEA requires that State and local report cards include the CRDC and EDFacts data disaggregated by any student group that is also required under the ESEA (i.e., major racial and ethnic groups, English learners, gender and children with disabilities). The CRDC is a biennial (i.e., every other school year) survey required by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR). Since 1968, through the CRDC, OCR has collected data on key education and civil rights issues in the nation's public schools for use by OCR in its enforcement and monitoring efforts regarding equal educational opportunity."
F,F-1a,What chronic absenteeism data must SEAs and LEAs include on report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C); EDFacts file specification 195,"Starting in school year 2017-2018, chronic absenteeism data was no longer collected through the CRDC and instead was solely collected through EDFacts, which, for file specification 195, is a data collection conducted pursuant to section 203(c)(1) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3413(c)(1)). Therefore, State and local report cards must include the data collected in EDFacts file specification 195 on the rates of chronic absenteeism, including both excused and unexcused absences. EDFacts is an initiative by the Department that centralizes performance data supplied by SEAs with other data assets, such as financial grant information, within the Department to enable better analysis and use in policy development, planning, and management."
F,F-2,What information regarding the categories of CRDC data required under the ESEA must SEAs and LEAs include on report cards to meet this requirement?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"The CRDC collects and reports on several measures from which an SEA and LEA must select to include on State and local report cards to meet the reporting requirement. Due to the way the CRDC data are reported, some measures may be comprised of more than one survey item in order to capture data on all students. An SEA and LEA may include multiple measures within each category, but the ESEA requires that report cards include at least one measure within each category. The categories include: In-school suspensions (DISC-9b and DISC-7b); Out-of-school suspensions (DISC-11, DISC-9c, DISC-7c, DISC-9d, DISC-7d, and optional DISC-12, DISC-2, DISC-1a); Expulsions (DISC-9e, DISC-7e, DISC-9f, DISC-7f, DISC-9g, DISC-7g, and optional DISC-1b); School-related arrests (ARRS-2b and ARRS-1b); Referrals to law enforcement (ARRS-2a and ARRS-1a); Incidents of harassment or bullying (HIBS-1a, HIBS-1b, and optional HIBS-1c, HIBS-2a, HIBS-2b, HIBS-2c, HIBS-3a, HIBS-3b, HIBS-3c); Incidents of violent offenses (OFFN-1, and optional OFFN-2 through OFFN-10); Preschool programs (PSCH-1); and Accelerated coursework to earn postsecondary credit (APIB-6, APIB-2, PENR-4, and optional APIB-8, APIB-10, APIB-12). The State report card and report cards for each LEA in the State should include the same measures(s) within each category."
F,F-3,What preschool enrollment information is an SEA and LEA required to include on report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii); (h)(1)(D)(i); and (h)(2)(C),"SEAs and LEAs are only required to report preschool enrollment data that are submitted in accordance with the CRDC data collection. The CRDC preschool enrollment data only include information on the number of children served in an LEA's preschool program(s) or service(s), including programs and services that are provided by a non-LEA facility that has been contracted by the LEA. The CRDC data collection does not include data necessary to calculate the percentage of students enrolled in preschool programs, nor does it include information on children receiving preschool services provided under State-administered preschool programs or by other entities, such as community-based organizations. Therefore, SEAs and LEAs are not required to include such information on report cards. In addition to the required CRDC data on the number of students enrolled in preschool programs, an SEA and LEA may choose to include other information related to preschool enrollment on report cards, such as the number and percentage of students enrolled in preschool programs not included in the CRDC. If an SEA or LEA elects to include such information, it should report this information separately."
F,F-4,How does an SEA and LEA determine the percentage of students enrolled in accelerated coursework to earn postsecondary credit while still in high school?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"To determine the percentage of students enrolled in accelerated coursework to earn postsecondary credit while still in high school, an SEA and LEA would use a school's enrollment as reflected on the CRDC's Student Enrollment survey items as the denominator. To the extent that using school-wide student enrollment as the denominator would undermine the comparability of data for certain schools (e.g., K-12 schools) an SEA or LEA may also determine the percentage using a denominator from an alternate data source (e.g., based on enrollment in grades 9-12). If an SEA or LEA elects to include such information, it should report this information separately."
F,F-5,Does the ESEA require that the SEA and LEA use the CRDC data described in question F-2 to meet the reporting requirements?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"Yes. At a minimum, the ESEA requires that SEAs and LEAs use CRDC data to meet the reporting requirements under ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C). To support SEAs and LEAs in doing so, the Department will make available to SEAs the CRDC data that the ESEA requires them to use to meet this reporting requirement. For an SEA in which LEAs produce local report cards (as opposed to instances where the SEA produces the local report cards), the SEA would be responsible for providing each LEA with the CRDC data that must be used to meet this reporting requirement."
F,F-6,How can an SEA and LEA meet their privacy obligations while including the CRDC data on State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,FERPA; ESEA section 1111(i),"The best way an SEA and LEA can avoid risking a privacy disclosure in the CRDC data included on report cards is to use CRDC data files available from the Department. This will ensure that appropriate and consistent methodologies for protecting student privacy are uniformly applied to the data that will be used in the report cards. This also will ensure that information that is provided on State and local report cards is aligned with what the Department provides in its public release of CRDC data, thus ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of disclosure of personally identifiable information. If an SEA or LEA uses data submitted to the Department and applies its own privacy protections, instead of the data released by the Department to which privacy protection routines have been applied, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to avoid an inadvertent disclosure when using the data released by the SEA or LEA in combination with data released by the Department."
F,F-7,Does the ESEA require that the SEA and LEA include CRDC data on report cards annually?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"Yes. The ESEA requires an SEA and its LEAs to include CRDC data annually on their report cards. Since the CRDC is a biennial data collection, SEAs and LEAs may include the same information on report cards over consecutive years, using the most recently available data provided by the Department, in order to meet this reporting requirement."
F,F-8,What if an SEA or LEA has more recent CRDC data than what is available in the CRDC data file provided by the Department?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"The Department recognizes that SEAs and LEAs may have access to data on the items used to fulfill this reporting requirement that are more recent than the most recent CRDC data. At a minimum, the ESEA requires that an SEA and its LEAs use the CRDC data when reporting on school quality, climate, and safety, preschool enrollment, and accelerated coursework on State and local report cards. Using CRDC data, as provided by the Department, helps ensure consistency across SEAs and LEAs in how the data items are defined, reported, and protected with respect to privacy. As noted in questions B-2 and C-2, SEAs and LEAs can include additional information on report cards if they wish to do so. Therefore, an SEA or LEA may include on report cards information that they collect annually that represents data on the same metric that LEAs submit for the purposes of the CRDC biannually during years when new CRDC data are not available. If an SEA or LEA elects to include such information, it should report this information separately and specify each additional data source."
F,F-9,May an SEA or an LEA provide a web link to CRDC data on its report card in lieu of including the actual CRDC data?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),No. It is not sufficient for an SEA or an LEA to provide a link to the State CRDC data posted on the Department website. An SEA and an LEA must include on their report cards the information required under ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C).
F,F-10,Which school year of CRDC data must SEAs and LEAs include on the report cards and how can SEAs and LEAs obtain the data file(s)?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"State and local report cards must include data on school quality, climate, and safety, preschool enrollment, and accelerated coursework from the most recent CRDC data. For example, State and local report cards that include information from the 2023-2024 school year may use the CRDC data from the 2020-2021 school year. Individual State-specific files of the CRDC data will be available to States on the ED Data Express website at https://eddataexpress.ed.gov/resources/reports-and-files/crdc-state-files. SEAs and LEAs do not need to delay the release of report cards because they are waiting for more recent CRDC data."
F,F-11,In what format will the CRDC data be provided?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"Each State-specific CRDC data file, which contains data for all schools for which LEAs submitted data within the State, will be made available to SEAs in a commonly used open data format, such as CSV or XML or JSON."
F,F-12,Where can an SEA and LEA find documentation about the CRDC data file(s)?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"The User Guide for the CRDC provides information about the purpose of the data collection, the target population and respondents, data anomalies and considerations, data collection procedures, the data file structure, and data processing. In addition, the CRDC survey forms are also available. All of the data documentation for the CRDC is available at https://civilrightsdata.ed.gov/data."
F,F-13,What privacy protections are implemented in the CRDC data files?,SEA and LEA,FERPA (20 U.S.C.1232g; 34 CFR Part 99),"The Department applies privacy protection routines to the CRDC data that LEAs submit. The CRDC data that are derived from personally identifiable information contained within students' education records are protected by FERPA. In the publicly available data files, statistical disclosure limitation methods have been applied to reduce the risk of disclosure of individual student information. The specific rounding methodologies for the privacy protection routines are described in the User Guide for the CRDC data file. Non-student information (e.g., teacher counts and dollar figures) is not subject to the same privacy provisions and is therefore not rounded. The data documentation contains language that an SEA and its LEAs may include on their report cards to describe the privacy protection rules and important considerations for interpreting the privacy-protected data."
F,F-14,What should an SEA do if the data submitted for the CRDC are missing or incomplete?,SEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"In the case in which an LEA is missing from the CRDC data file or in which an LEA is missing data on key element(s), the ESEA requires that the SEA still report the required data to produce a State report card based on the LEAs that are included in the file that the Department provides to SEAs. The SEA may choose to annotate the report card to indicate that data for a particular LEA are missing. In such cases, the LEA may choose to report on other data sources that measure the same or similar metrics; however, the LEA must note that the CRDC data are missing."
F,F-15,What level of CRDC data must be included on State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(vii) and (h)(2)(C),"The ESEA requires SEAs and LEAs to report information submitted in accordance with the CRDC data collected pursuant to section 203(c)(1) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3413(c)(1)). For a majority of these data elements (e.g., school climate and accelerated coursework), SEAs and LEAs submit CRDC data only at the school level. Thus, an SEA and its LEAs must report these school-level CRDC data on State and local report cards. An SEA and its LEAs are not required to aggregate the school-level CRDC data at the State or LEA levels. However, an SEA and its LEAs may choose to provide CRDC data aggregated at the State or LEA levels to provide additional context and to allow for easier comparisons. For those few CRDC data elements (e.g., preschool enrollment data) that are reported at both the LEA and school levels, State report cards must include both the LEA- and school-level data and local report cards must include both LEA and school-level data. An SEA also may choose to provide these CRDC data aggregated at the State level to provide additional context and to allow for easier comparisons. Any SEA and LEA interested in publishing SEA or LEA aggregations of CRDC data should be aware of the complex privacy risks potentially caused by the interconnection of these aggregations with the existing privacy protections applied to the school-level data. SEAs and LEAs interested in aggregating the CRDC data to the State or LEA levels are encouraged to contact the Department's PTAC for support in developing a compatible disclosure avoidance plan by emailing PrivacyTA@ed.gov."
F,F-16,Does the ESEA require that the SEA and LEA include EDFacts chronic absenteeism data on report cards annually?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"Yes. An SEA and its LEAs must include chronic absenteeism data collected through EDFacts annually on their report cards. Since the chronic absenteeism data is an annual collection, SEAs and LEAs must report updated chronic absenteeism data on an annual basis in order to meet this reporting requirement."
F,F-17,Must an SEA or LEA report the most recent available chronic absenteeism data?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),"Yes, an SEA or LEA must report the SEA's most recently available chronic absenteeism data regardless of whether it has already been submitted by the SEA through EDFacts. In contrast to the CRDC collection process (where LEAs submit information directly to the Department), SEAs report chronic absenteeism data annually via EDFacts. Reporting this data will promote consistency across the SEA and LEAs in how these data are defined and reported. In addition, SEAs should report these data on State and local report cards as soon as they are available so that the public has access to timely information. For example, we strongly encourage an SEA to include chronic absenteeism data from school year 2023-2024 when an SEA publishes its State and local report cards for that school year in fall 2024, even though the SEA is not required to report the data to the Department until later in the year."
F,F-18,What level of chronic absenteeism data collected through EDFacts must be included on State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(vii) and (h)(2)(C); EDFacts file specification 195,"SEAs and LEAs are required to submit via EDFacts chronic absenteeism data in accordance with EDFacts file specification 195 submitted to the Department in accordance with a data collection conducted pursuant to section 203(c)(1) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3413(c)(1)). These data must be reported for the all-students group, major racial ethnic group, children with disabilities, gender, and English learner student group, and are defined as the unduplicated number of students in grades kindergarten through grade 12, who were enrolled in the school for at least 10 school days at any time during the school year, and who were absent 10 percent or more of the school days in the school in which they were enrolled. In accordance with EDFacts file specification 195: 'A student was absent if he or she was not physically on school grounds and was not participating in instruction or instruction-related activities at an approved off-grounds location for at least half the school day.' Because SEAs submit through EDFacts the chronic absenteeism data at the State, LEA, and school levels, State report cards must include, at a minimum, State-level data, and local report cards must include LEA-level and school-level data."
F,F-19,May an SEA or an LEA provide a web link to the data collected through EDFacts data on its report card in lieu of including the actual EDFacts data?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C),No. It is not sufficient for an SEA or an LEA to provide a link to the State data submitted through EDFacts posted on the Department website. An SEA and an LEA must include on their report cards the information required under ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C).
F,F-20,"If an SEA uses chronic absenteeism as an indicator in its ESEA accountability system, may it report these accountability data instead of chronic absenteeism data from file 195 on its State and local report cards?",SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C); ESEA section 1111(c)(4)(B)(v); 20 U.S.C. 3413(c)(1),"No. SEAs and LEAs are required, under ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii) and (h)(2)(C), to report information submitted in accordance with EDFacts file 195 for chronic absenteeism because that information is submitted to the Department in accordance with a data collection conducted pursuant to section 203(c)(1) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3413(c)(1)). Indicator data as part of the State's approved accountability system under ESEA section 1111(c)(4)(B)(v) is not submitted to ED in accordance with a data collection conducted pursuant to section 203(c)(1) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3413(c)(1)). These indicator data may differ because they can be based on the SEA's definition of chronic absenteeism as an indicator in the State accountability system, rather than the definition established in EDFacts. A State that uses chronic absenteeism as an indicator in its accountability system as either a School Quality or Student Success or Other Academic indicator for elementary and secondary schools that are not high schools must also include in its State and local report cards information on performance on the indicator (as required under ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(iii)(I) or (h)(1)(C)(v)), in addition to the chronic absenteeism data required under ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(viii)."
G,G-1,What information must State and local report cards include on educator qualifications?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(ix) and (h)(2)(C),"The ESEA requires that each State and local report card include, in the aggregate and disaggregated by high-poverty and low-poverty schools, the number and percentages of (1) inexperienced teachers, principals, and other school leaders; (2) teachers teaching with emergency or provisional credentials; and (3) teachers who are not teaching in the subject or field for which the teacher is certified or licensed (i.e., out-of-field teachers). These requirements differ from the educator equity reporting requirements under ESEA section 1111(g)(1)(B), which each State defines in its ESEA consolidated State plan."
G,G-2,What definitions apply to the requirement that each SEA and LEA report on educator qualifications?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 8101(44); 34 CFR § 200.2(b)(11),"Section 8101(44) of the ESEA defines a school leader as a principal, assistant principal, or other individual who is: (1) an employee or officer of an elementary school or secondary school, LEA, or other entity operating an elementary school or secondary school; and (2) responsible for the daily instructional leadership and managerial operations in the elementary school or secondary school building. Thus, in the context of State and local report cards, 'other school leaders' includes individuals other than principals that meet the definition of a school leader. The remaining terms applicable to reporting educator qualifications are not defined by the ESEA for reporting purposes. An SEA may, at its discretion, consider adopting a uniform, statewide definition of additional terms in order to ensure consistency and comparability across the State with respect to reporting on educator qualifications. For example, an SEA may choose to define a 'high-poverty school' as a school in the top quartile of poverty in the State and a 'low-poverty school' as a school in the bottom quartile of poverty in the State. When defining high- and low-poverty schools, the Department recommends that SEAs use information on poverty levels rather than a school's Title I status to ensure a more consistent definition of poverty. The Department recommends that an SEA adopt a uniform, statewide definition of the term 'teachers who are not teaching in the subject or field for which the teacher is certified or licensed' that is consistent with the State's definition of 'out-of-field' teachers used for educator equity in its ESEA consolidated State plan. Similarly, the Department recommends that an SEA adopt a uniform, statewide definition of the term 'inexperienced teachers' that is consistent with the State's definition of inexperienced teachers in its ESEA consolidated State plan."
G,G-3,"Apart from State and local report card requirements, what other information must an SEA publicly report on educators under Title I, Part A of the ESEA?",SEA,ESEA section 1111(g)(1)(B),"Each SEA is required to describe in its ESEA consolidated State plan how low-income and minority children enrolled in Title I schools are not served at disproportionate rates by ineffective, out-of-field, and inexperienced teachers, and the measures the State will use to evaluate and publicly report the progress of the State with respect to such description. The Department encourages the SEA to report on its progress towards achieving educator equity at least every two years. The SEA's reporting on disproportionate rates of ineffective, out-of-field, and inexperienced teachers differs from the educator qualification information for State and local report cards under ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(ix) and (h)(2)(C). On State and local report cards, SEAs must report educator qualification information in the aggregate and disaggregate by high-poverty and low-poverty schools, whereas, for the educator equity measures required in ESEA consolidated State plans, SEAs must publicly report progress on how low-income and minority children enrolled in Title I schools are not taught at disproportionate rates by ineffective, out-of-field, and inexperienced teachers. To support access and transparency, the Department recommends that each SEA centralize its reporting for Title I requirements in one location. An SEA could accomplish this by publicly reporting both the ESEA consolidated State plan educator equity information and State and local report card educator qualification information in the same location on the State's report cards. At a minimum, the Department recommends that SEAs include a link from their State and local report cards to their educator equity State plan information."
H,H-1,What information must State and local report cards include on per-pupil expenditures?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(x) and (h)(2)(C),"The ESEA requires that State report cards include 'the per-pupil expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds, including actual personnel expenditures and actual nonpersonnel expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds, disaggregated by source of funds, for each local educational agency and each school in the State for the preceding fiscal year.' The ESEA also requires that local report cards, for the LEA overall and for each school in the LEA, include per-pupil expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds, including actual personnel expenditures and actual nonpersonnel expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds, disaggregated by source funds for the LEA and each school served by the LEA. Simply put, the State's report card must include the requisite per-pupil expenditure information for all LEAs and schools in the State; the local report cards must include the requisite per-pupil expenditure information for the LEA and all schools in the LEA."
H,H-2,Can an SEA and its LEAs follow different procedures when calculating per-pupil expenditure data for State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(x) and (h)(2)(C),"Yes; however, the establishment of a uniform calculation of per-pupil expenditures by an SEA facilitates the comparison of the distribution of school funding within and across LEAs. Although an SEA has discretion to allow LEAs to establish their own procedures for calculating per-pupil expenditures, if an SEA wants to ensure that data are uniform, understandable, and comparable across each LEA and school in a State, the SEA may establish uniform statewide procedures for calculation of per-pupil expenditures."
H,H-3,Can an SEA and LEA report per-pupil expenditures on State and local report cards by including average salary costs for school-level staff?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(x); (h)(1)(C)(xiv); (h)(2)(D),"No. The ESEA requires that actual personnel and nonpersonnel expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds be used to calculate the per-pupil expenditure figures that must be included on State and local report cards. However, an SEA could include average salary costs for school-level staff under the additional information section of its report card, provided the State believes including such information will inform parents, students, and other members of the public about how resources are allocated in elementary and secondary schools. In addition, an LEA may include on local report cards any other information it determines to be appropriate, regardless of whether that information is included on the State report card."
H,H-4,What expenditures are included in the numerator and denominator when calculating per-pupil expenditures for State and local report cards?,SEA and LEA,ESEA section 1111(h)(1)(C)(x); ESEA section 8101(12),"Numerator: The ESEA requires that per-pupil expenditure calculations include actual personnel and nonpersonnel expenditures of all Federal, State, and local funds, disaggregated by source of funds. Because some types of expenditures typically are excluded for annual reporting purposes from these broad categories (e.g., capital expenditures), an SEA has some flexibility in determining the specific categories of expenditures to include. However, this flexibility does not negate the responsibility to include all actual personnel and non-personnel expenditures, absent a compelling reason to exclude them. Generally, an SEA and its LEAs should not include expenditures that, if reported, would skew expenditures in certain years and thwart comparison from year to year. To reduce burden, an SEA and its LEAs have the flexibility to align their procedures with existing NCES data collection procedures. Under NCES data collection and publication procedures, the numerator for per-pupil expenditures consists of current expenditures, which are comprised of expenditures for the day-to-day operation of schools and LEAs for public elementary and secondary education, including expenditures for staff salaries and benefits, supplies, and purchased services. General administration expenditures and school administration expenditures are also included in current expenditures. Expenditures associated with repaying debts and capital outlays (e.g., purchases of land, school construction and equipment) are excluded from current expenditures. Programs outside the scope of public prekindergarten through grade 12 education, such as community services and adult education, are not included in current expenditures. Payments to private schools and payments to charter schools outside of the school district are also excluded from current expenditures. Denominator: An SEA and its LEAs have discretion to determine a student count procedure (e.g., membership with a fall count date, averaged count of students in membership over the school year, membership count with multiple count dates, averaged count of students in attendance over the school year) to calculate per-pupil expenditures for State and local report cards. If an SEA identifies a statewide student count procedure, it should: (1) Ensure the year for which the student count procedure aligns with the school year in which expenditures are counted; (2) Consider aligning the statewide student count procedure with existing NCES data collection procedures; (3) Ensure the student count procedure specifies whether preschool students are counted; (4) Evaluate whether the student count procedure selected systematically under- or over-counts students."
H,H-5,Should funds received from private sources be included in per-pupil expenditure calculations?,SEA and LEA,N/A,"An SEA and its LEAs have the flexibility to determine whether expenditures based on private contributions should be included in per-pupil expenditure calculations. For example, the F-33 collects data on private contributions, which it defines as gifts of cash or securities from private individuals or organizations. An SEA may want to, however, clarify how it treats such funds in its per-pupil expenditure reporting procedures. If an SEA decides that expenditures paid from funds received from private sources are required to be included in the numerator, then the SEA should clarify for LEAs how to categorize such funds."
